# Testing Guidelines and Best Practices

This document provides guidelines for conducting ethical and effective performance testing of Tokopedia.

## Ethical Testing Guidelines

### 1. Authorization and Permission
- **Always obtain proper authorization** before conducting performance tests against any website
- **Test only against appropriate environments** (staging, pre-production, or specifically designated test environments)
- **Never test against production** without explicit permission and coordination with the target organization
- **Respect robots.txt** and website terms of service

### 2. Rate Limiting and Courtesy
- **Implement reasonable delays** between requests to avoid overwhelming the server
- **Start with small loads** and gradually increase to understand the system's capacity
- **Monitor for error rates** and back off if errors exceed 5%
- **Use realistic user behavior patterns** with appropriate think times

### 3. Data Privacy
- **Never use real customer data** in your tests
- **Use synthetic or anonymized test data** only
- **Avoid accessing personal or sensitive information** during testing
- **Clean up any test data** created during testing

## Performance Testing Best Practices

### Test Planning

1. **Define Clear Objectives**
   - Identify specific performance metrics to measure
   - Set realistic performance targets
   - Define success criteria for tests

2. **Environment Preparation**
   - Use dedicated test environments when possible
   - Ensure test environment mirrors production characteristics
   - Coordinate with system administrators

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Design realistic user journeys
   - Include both normal and peak load scenarios
   - Test critical business functions

### Test Execution

1. **Gradual Load Increase**
   ```bash
   # Start with smoke tests
   ./scripts/run-test.sh test-plans/ui/tokopedia-homepage-test.jmx default "-Jusers=1 -Jduration=60"
   
   # Progress to light load
   ./scripts/run-test.sh test-plans/ui/tokopedia-homepage-test.jmx default "-Jusers=10 -Jduration=300"
   
   # Then moderate load
   ./scripts/run-test.sh test-plans/ui/tokopedia-homepage-test.jmx default "-Jusers=50 -Jduration=600"
   ```

2. **Monitor System Resources**
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
   - Watch for error patterns
   - Track response times and throughput

3. **Documentation**
   - Record test conditions and environment details
   - Document any issues or anomalies
   - Save and analyze test results

### Result Analysis

1. **Key Metrics to Analyze**
   - Response time (average, median, 90th, 95th, 99th percentiles)
   - Throughput (requests per second)
   - Error rate (should be < 1% for acceptable performance)
   - Resource utilization

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Compare results across different test runs
   - Identify performance degradation over time
   - Look for patterns in error occurrences

## Load Testing Levels

### 1. Smoke Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify basic functionality under minimal load
- **Load**: 1-5 users
- **Duration**: 1-5 minutes
- **Usage**: Quick validation before larger tests

### 2. Load Testing
- **Purpose**: Test normal expected load
- **Load**: 10-50 users
- **Duration**: 5-30 minutes
- **Usage**: Baseline performance measurement

### 3. Stress Testing
- **Purpose**: Find the breaking point
- **Load**: 50-200+ users
- **Duration**: 15-60 minutes
- **Usage**: Identify system limits

### 4. Spike Testing
- **Purpose**: Test sudden load increases
- **Load**: Rapid increase from baseline to peak
- **Duration**: Short bursts
- **Usage**: Validate system resilience

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Testing Production Without Permission**
   - Always get explicit authorization
   - Consider legal and ethical implications

2. **Unrealistic Test Scenarios**
   - Don't ignore think times
   - Model realistic user behavior
   - Consider geographic distribution

3. **Ignoring System Resources**
   - Monitor both client and server resources
   - Don't run tests on resource-constrained machines
   - Account for network limitations

4. **Poor Test Data Management**
   - Use varied, realistic test data
   - Avoid data dependencies between test runs
   - Clean up test artifacts

## Reporting and Communication

### Test Reports Should Include:
- Test objectives and success criteria
- Test environment details
- Load patterns and scenarios executed
- Key performance metrics and analysis
- Issues identified and recommendations
- Appendix with detailed results

### Communication Guidelines:
- Share results with relevant stakeholders
- Provide context for performance metrics
- Suggest actionable improvements
- Schedule regular performance testing cycles

## Emergency Procedures

If you notice any of the following during testing, **immediately stop the test**:
- Error rates exceeding 10%
- Response times increasing exponentially
- Indication of system instability
- Any sign that the test is affecting production services

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

- Ensure compliance with local and international laws
- Respect intellectual property rights
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities found
- Maintain confidentiality of test results if required

## Conclusion

Effective performance testing requires a balance of technical expertise, ethical conduct, and business understanding. Always prioritize the stability and security of the systems under test while gathering meaningful performance insights.
